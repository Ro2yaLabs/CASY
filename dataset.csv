Astonishingly statistical analyses are virtually absent from T laboratory activities. When a formal requirement exists it seems that statistics are left to being taught in a mathematics course removed from practical application in microbiology.
Teaching statistics from a mathematical rather than a practical approach is a recognized problem that produces students who learn how to apply statistical procedures but are challenged deciding when to use them.
Recommendations by statistics educators include teaching statistics in more of a hands on manner and promoting statistics as an experimental science and less as a mathematics course. Another strategy is to establish a clear link between statistics and its application to the real world.
